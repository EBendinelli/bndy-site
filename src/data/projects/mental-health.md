In 2019 at Privacy International, I led a project looking into online tracking and profiling practices of websites addressing depression. The aim of the project, named [Your Mental Health for Sale](https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/your-mental-health-sale), was to expose how intimate data about us can be collected, shared and processed by third parties, without users consent or knowledge.

I conducted technical research and [co-produced a report](https://privacyinternational.org/node/3193) exposing the abusive data collection practices of some publishers including sharing answers to depression tests with third parties without informing users and loading marketing trackers before consent.

Following this work, a number of websites mentioned in the report [changed their practices](https://privacyinternational.org/report/3351/mental-health-websites-dont-have-sell-your-data-most-still-do) to reduce or eliminate data sharing of intimate information with third-parties.

This research served as the basis for a [complaint against Doctissimo](https://privacyinternational.org/legal-action/complaint-against-doctissimo) to French data authority CNIL, one of the worst offender that did not change its practices following the report. This complaint led to the company [being fined 380,000â‚¬](https://www.cnil.fr/en/health-data-and-use-cookies-doctissimo-fined-eu380000) in May 2023 for GDPR infringement.
