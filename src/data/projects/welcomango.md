Welcomango was an idea that started in 2014 and began development in 2015. The goal was to create platform for travelers to meet locals offering experiences reflecting with their interests and passions. Experiences offered by locals could be free or paid for, and could be booked through the platform. This was sort of a couchsurfing for travel experiences rather than bed.

Initially a side project, development was very slow at first and picked up in 2016 thanks to the help of a good friend. The platform was developed in Php using Symfony 2. A somewhat functional version of the site can be found on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20181228072421/http://welcomango.com/).

With little experience in entrepreneurship and few resources available, growth was mostly driven by friends and their friends, with limited results. With about 80 users at its peak, the website closed down in 2019.
