I'm not a full time web developper anymore and so every couple of years I try to give myself a new tech project/challenge to keep my skills sharps and learn new things.

2025 is the year I built myself a personal site, learned about Astro, dived into modern development tools with VSCode, Cursor, Github Actions, Docker and more...

Tech stack:
- Framework: Astro
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Type checking: Typescript
