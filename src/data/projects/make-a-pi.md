[Make a PI](https://make-a-pi.netlify.app/) is logo generator for Privacy International (PI). 

When the organisation rebranded in 2020, abandonning the strikethrough logo in favour of a more colorful and dynamic one, I developed this logo generator as a side-project. It was an opportunity to learn a JS framework I was curious about ([React](https://react.dev/)) and experiment with SVG.

Users can pick colours taken from PI's brand guidelines, chose to have a gradient or flat colour, pick the opacity and updload a background image.
