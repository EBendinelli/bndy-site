I'm Eliot Bendinelli, I'm a musician, a privacy nerd, a developer, and an internet dreamer that hasn't lost all hope, yet. I've worked in UN organisations ([ITU](itu.int), [UNEP](unep.org)), a European [think tank](https://www.thinkyoung.eu/), web companies ([Acyba](https://www.acymailing.com/) & [Hikashop](https://www.hikashop.com/)) and for the past 6 years, I was at [Privacy International](https://privacyinternational.org) as Technologist and Programme Lead for the Corporate Exploitation programme. 

In that position, I worked to defend privacy and challenge government and corporate surveillance, conducting technical research, leading successful advocacy and policy efforts, and coordinating global 
campaigns against abusive uses of technology, strengthening access to human rights in the digital world. 

I am currently supporting a fairly new organisation, [Data Rights](https://datarights.ngo), to develop its strategy on data portability and interoperability matters with the aim to open up tech monopolies while protecting privacy and security. 

I also offer consultancy services including policy development, educational content, advocacy strategy, tech research and AI position development. Don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:eliot@bndy.org) if you want to have a chat.
