I'm Eliot Bendinelli, I'm a musician, a privacy nerd, and an internet 
dreamer that hasn't lost all hopes yet. For the past 6 years, I worked 
at [Privacy International](https://privacyinternational.org) as Technologist and Programme Lead for the 
Corporate Exploitation programme. Defending privacy and fighting government 
and corporate surveillance, I conducted conducted impactful technical research, 
led successful advocacy and policy efforts, and coordinated global 
campaigns against abusive uses of technology, acting to strengthen 
access to human rights in the digital world.

Some of my work, such as "Your mental health for sale" that exposed the collection and sharing of 
sensitive health data, has obtained coverage in major newspapers, 
creating impact in the form of regulatory action or changes in company 
practices. Challenging monopolies in digital markets, I have supported 
PI's interventions in multiple merger cases involving Big 
Tech companies, including Meta/Giphy and Google/Fitbit, and 
advocated for strong privacy and security provisions in criticaal 
European legislations such as the Digital Market Act. 

I'm currently suporting a fairly new organisation, [Data Rights](https://datarights.ngo),
to develop its strategy on data portability and interoperability matters to 
continue the fight for individual rights and open up tech monopolies while respecting 
privacy and security.
